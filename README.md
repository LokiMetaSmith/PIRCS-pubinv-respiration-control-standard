# The Public Invention Respiration Control Standard (PIRCS)
A parallel standard to the closely related [Public Invention Respriation Data Standard](https://github.com/PubInv/respiration-data-standard), this is a control standard for controlling air drives for COVID-19 pandemic ventilators.

At the moment, this standard is a very earl draft as a [google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GAtxZuAMIIyBtoIOIv2E33LgPCoJRNjkZKz-jUzVjy4/edit#heading=h.7386erwqsdnv).
